<h2>My favourite movies of all time listed below</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>Big Mamas House 3</h3>
<p>This is was my ultimate favourite movie as a child. I love how quirky and unserious it is while also quite mysterious with the investigative element.</p>
<h3>School of Rock</h3>
<p>The movie is about a struggling muscian who pretends to be a substitute teacher. He sees this as an opportunity to "revive" his musical career by teacher his learners music for them to compete and win in a competition.</p>
<h3>Good Burger</h3>
<p>If you know, you know. The movie is just very humerious. My favourite bar is: Good burger <br />
